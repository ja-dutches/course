    "# Use Objects and Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python programming language is an example of **Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "(OOP)**, which means that we store our information in **objects**. In Python, a string is an\n",
    "example of an object. Strings are very simple objects - they only hold one piece of\n",
    "information (their value) - but a single object can be very complex. Objects can even\n",
    "hold other objects inside of them. This helps to give structure and organization to our\n",
    "programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if we wanted to model a car, we would (hypothetically) create a Car object\n",
    "that holds lots of descriptive information about the car, called its **attributes**. It would have\n",
    "a color attribute, a model attribute, etc., and each of these attributes would hold one\n",
    "piece of descriptive information about the car. It would also include different objects like\n",
    "Tires, Doors, and an Engine that all have their own attributes as well.\n",
    "Different objects also have different capabilities, called **methods**. For instance, our Car\n",
    "object might have a `drive()` method and a `park()` method. Since these methods\n",
    "belong to the car, we use them with **\"dot notation\"** by putting them next to the object and\n",
    "after a period, like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "car.park()\n",
    "```\n",
    "Methods are followed by parentheses, because sometimes methods use input. For\n",
    "instance, if we wanted to drive the car object a distance of 50, we would place that input\n",
    "of 50 in the parentheses of the \"drive\" method:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "car.drive(50)\n",
    "```\n",
    "There are certain methods that belong to string objects as well. For instance, there is a\n",
    "string method called `upper()` that creates an upper-case version of the string.\n",
    "(Likewise, there is a corresponding method `lower()` that creates a lower-case version\n",
    "of a string.) Let's give it a try:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In []: loud_voice = \"Can you hear me yet?\"\n",
    "       print(loud_voice.upper())\n",
    "```       "

    "example of a general-purpose function, the `len()` function, which can be used to\n",
    "tell us the length of many different types of objects, including strings. This is why\n",
