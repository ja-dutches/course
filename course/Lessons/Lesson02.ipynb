    "\n",
    "As we've already seen, you write strings in Python by surrounding them with quotes. You can use single quotes or double quotes, as long as you're consistent for any one string. All of the following lines create string variables (called string literals because we've literally written out exactly how they look):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. phrase = 'Hello, world.\n",
    "2. my_string = \"We're #1!\"\n",
    "3. string_number = \"1234\"\n",
    "4. conversation = 'I said, \"Put it over by the llama.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings can include any characters - letters, numbers and symbols. You can see the benefit of using either single or double quotes in the last string example; since we used single quotes, we didn't have any trouble putting double quotes inside the string. (There are other ways to do this, but we'll get to those later in the chapter.) \n",
    "\n",
    "We can also create really long strings that take up multiple lines by using three single quotes (or three double quotes), like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "long_string = '''This is a \n",
    "string that spans across multiple lines'''\n",
    "\n",
    "long_string = \"\"\"This is a new string\n",
    "that spans across two lines\"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here we assigned one value to the variable long_string, then we overwrote that value with a new string literal. Try putting this in a script and then print the variable long_string; you'll see that it displays the string on two separate lines."

    "It's also worth noting that you can preserve whitespace if you use triple quotes:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"\"\"this is a\n",
    "    string that spans across multiple lines\n",
    "        that also preseves whitespace.\"\"\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "One last thing about strings: If you want to write out a really long string, but you don't want it to appear on multiple lines, you can use a backslash like this when writing it out:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_long_string = \"Here's a string that I want to \\\n",
    "write across multiple lines since it is long.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally Python would get to the end of the first line and get angry with you because you hadn't closed the string with a matching single quote. But because there's a backslash at the end, you can just keep writing the same string on the next line. This is different from the last example since the actual string isn't stored on multiple lines this time, therefore the string gets displayed on a single line without the break:\n",
    "\n",
    ">**WARNING**: As we've already discussed, Python is case-sensitive. By convention, Python's built-in functions and methods use exclusively lower-case. Since a single variable name can't include any spaces or dashes, when programmers want to give descriptive names to variables, one way of making them easily readable is to use camelCase (i.e., myLongString), so called because of the upper-case \"humps\" in the middle of terms. Another popular method (especially in Python),\n",
    "and the one we'll be sticking to in this course, is to separate words using underscores (i.e., my_long_string).`\n",

    "1. Print a string that used double quotation marks inside the string.\n",
    "2. Print a string that uses an apostrophe (single quote) inside the string.\n",
    "3. Print a string that spans accress multiple lines\n",
    "4. Print a one-line string that you have written out on multiple lines."
